I recently graduated from McMaster University and will be enrolling in the MD/PhD program at Western University beginning in Sep 2019. My research interests lies in elucidating how genetic changes ultimately lead to human diseases through the lens of molecular genetics and functional genomics. Using techniques such as RNA-seq and other applications of next-gen sequencing, I hope to translate the valuable insights I gain at the bench to directly benefit patient-care.
