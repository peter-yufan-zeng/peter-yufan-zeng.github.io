I recently graduated from McMaster University and will be enrolling in the MD/PhD program at Western University beginning in Sep 2019. My research interest lies in elucidating how genetic changes ultimately lead to human diseases through the lens of molecular genetics and functional genomics. Using techniques such as RNA-seq and other applications of next-gen sequencing, I hope to translate the valuable insights I gain at the bench to directly benefit patient-care.

During undergrad, I researched with [Dr. Mattew S. Miller (McMaster University)](https://fhs.mcmaster.ca/biochem/miller_matthew.html) studying the function of the protein SETX, a DNA/RNA helicase linked to two juvenile neurodegenerative disorders ALS4 and AOA2, in the antiviral response against HSV1. We demonstrated that HSV-1 infection may cause dysregulation of pathways known to be involved in neurodegeneration by both acting on the host and viral transcriptome.
